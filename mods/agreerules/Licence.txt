Its only 1 agrument.

(if you want to make another version / spread the mod)
You have to show me (UjEdwin) as the orginal creater

It does not mather what you is doing with the mod as long you folow this agrument.
So: its ok to do stuff like: use in public servers/edit/spread/upload/make an update / using in a video (like youtube)...


The reasons the the argument.
It does not feel good if someone takes hard work and or characteristics of your work, and says its him self created it.
In some mods i spended more then 30 hours... so its a good reason to add this license :-)
