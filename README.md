API
---

The Server is splitted into diffrent lobbys.

This is saved in player_lobby[name] = "main"

All minetest registers like minetest.register_on_join_player(func(player)) are here subgames.register_on_join_player(func(player, lobby)) lobby is the name string of the Lobby where the Action happens.

But not all registers are supported yet.

Example:

subgames.register_on_join_player(function(player, lobby)
  if lobby == "main" then
    minetest.chat_send_play(player:get_player_name(), "HI")
  end
end)

IMPORTANT: Registers like on_place_node don't allways have a player!
For this a Lobby must register its location at the top of mods/subgames/init.lua

areas={
  ["mesewars"] = {
    [1] = {x=(-76), y=158, z=154},
    [2] = {x=266, y=(-52), z=(-169)}
  },
  ["main"] = {
    [1] = {x=(-31), y=623, z=0},
    [2] = {x=9, y=595, z=39}
  },
  ["hiddenseeker"] = {
    [1] = {x=0, y=(-10000), z=0},
    [2] = {x=0, y=(-10000), z=0}
  },
  ["skywars"] = {
    [1] = {x=10000, y=1900, z=10000},
    [2] = {x=(-10000), y=2900, z=(-10000)}
  }
}

The API is not finished!
